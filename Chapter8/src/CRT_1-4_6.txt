#1 classes that Inherit another class have a "is a" relationship (A class "is a" type of another class) wheras a "has a" relationsip is one of composition
(this class "has a" method called bike()).

#2 both methods will be avilable to an object of the derived class. neither method overwirites the other and both would be able to be used.

#3 An abstract method has no body to it and when it is inherited a class specific body can be added. When you overwirte a method there was body before
and you are just making a new body for the sub class.

#4 an abstact class defines an abstract/general concept (like a vehicle) where as an Interface is a class with abstract methods. they key differance is 
an abstract class can be inherited where an interface cannot

#6
